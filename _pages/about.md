I am a teaching fellow in the [Department of Foundational Mathematics](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/study/departments/school-of-mathematics-and-physics/foundational-mathematics) at [Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en) (XJTLU). I completed my PhD in Mathematics at the [Graduate Center](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/Home) of the City University of New York (CUNY) in 2020, under the supervision of Professor [Brooke Feigon](https://bfeigon.ccny.cuny.edu/). From 2020 to 2024, I was a postdoc in the [Data Science Institute](https://dsi.sdu.edu.cn/) at Shandong University (SDU), working with Professor [Jianya Liu](http://www.prime.sdu.edu.cn/info/1023/1151.htm). 

My research interests are in number theory and representation theory. More specifically, my current work concerns central values of L-functions in higher rank and the relative trace formula.

My curriculum vitae is available [here](/files/CV_BGuan.pdf).
